## 🧠 OpenMind Interview Prep (Repetition-Driven Strategy)

**Role:** Founding Full Stack Engineer
**Tech Stack:** React, React Native, FastAPI, LLM Integration
**Interview Length:** 1 hour (practical, non-LeetCode)
**Goal:** Show fluent, product-minded mastery of a full-stack chatbot app with LLM backend.

## ✅ Focus Areas (Ranked by ROI)

| Area               | Time Focus | Why?                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧹 React + RN      | 30%        | Core UI layer — must be fluid with hooks, state, and inputs |
| ⚙️ FastAPI         | 30%        | Backend API design, validation, async, LLM proxy            |
| 🔄 Full-stack flow | 20%        | End-to-end integration + data handling                      |
| 🧠 LLM integration | 20%        | Real product differentiator — OpenMind is AI-native         |

## 🔁 Core Repetitions (Drill These Daily)

### 1. 🧹 React / React Native – Chat UI

* [ ] Controlled `TextInput` using `useState`
* [ ] Send on Enter / Submit button → call `sendMessage()`
* [ ] Append messages to state
* [ ] Render messages using `map()` / `FlatList`
* [ ] Scroll to bottom (`useRef` + `scrollToEnd`)
* [ ] Show loading state while waiting for LLM

**🧠 Target:** Rebuild from scratch in <10 min, no Google.

---

### 2. ⚙️ FastAPI – Clean API Design

* [ ] `@app.post("/chat")` route
* [ ] `pydantic` input model: `user_input`, `session_id`
* [ ] Async call to `llm.py` OpenAI function
* [ ] Return structured response with metadata
* [ ] Save both user + bot messages to DB/dict

**🧠 Target:** Write endpoint cleanly in <10 min.

---

### 3. 🔄 Chat Flow (Frontend → Backend → LLM)

* [ ] Submit → API call → update messages
* [ ] Handle loading, error, retry, abort
* [ ] Talk through call chain: UI → API → LLM → UI

**🧠 Target:** Explain end-to-end in <60 seconds.

---

### 4. 🧱 Chat Schema

```sql
messages (
  id UUID,
  session_id UUID,
  sender TEXT,        -- 'user' or 'bot'
  message TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  metadata JSONB
)

sessions (
  id UUID,
  title TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

**🧠 Target:** Recall schema instantly, explain purpose of each field.

---

### 5. 🧠 AI Integration Q\&A

* [ ] “How do you handle hallucinations?”
* [ ] “How do you retry failed LLM calls?”
* [ ] “How do you handle prompt structuring?”
* [ ] “How would you stream responses to the frontend?”

**🧠 Target:** 45–60 second crisp answers. No rambling.

---

## 📆 Daily Repetition Plan

### ✅ Friday (Late Night + Day)

* [ ] Rebuild chat UI (React)
* [ ] Rebuild `POST /chat` (FastAPI)
* [ ] End-to-end connection: React → FastAPI → stubbed LLM
* [ ] Say project walkthrough out loud
* [ ] Answer 2 LLM design Qs

---

### ✅ Saturday

* [ ] Rebuild chat UI (React Native via Expo)
* [ ] Rebuild API with new structure (`services`, `routes`)
* [ ] Add in-memory or SQLite chat storage
* [ ] Repeat all 5 core drills
* [ ] Record yourself explaining full stack flow

---

### ✅ Sunday

* [ ] Rebuild full stack project from scratch in 1–1.5h
* [ ] Add `/history` endpoint + session selector (optional)
* [ ] Do a mock interview (solo or with peer)
* [ ] Final polish on code (comments, structure, naming)
* [ ] Review and verbalize all talking points

---

### ✅ Monday (Pre-Interview)

* [ ] Rebuild chat UI + API one final time (speed round)
* [ ] Recite:

  * 2-min project walkthrough
  * End-to-end system design
  * All LLM handling Qs
* [ ] Relax, trust repetition

## 🗣 Interview Talking Points (Drill Aloud)

> “I built a full-stack chatbot using React, React Native, and FastAPI that integrates with OpenAI.”

> “I store all messages by session, using a message model with role, content, timestamp, and optional metadata.”

> “The AI logic is abstracted into a separate service file — easy to retry, trace, and plug into any model.”

> “Frontend and backend are decoupled. Backend handles validation and business logic, while frontend handles UX and async flow.”

> “I’ve rebuilt the entire stack multiple times to ensure fluency and clarity.”

## 🧠 Final Reminder

Looking like an expert = **repetition, fluency, and control**.
Don't try to do more. Do **less**, but do it **fast, clean, and confidently**.
