# üéØ Full-Stack Interview Preparation Guide

## üìã Behavioral Questions to Prepare

### Tell Me About Yourself
- **Structure**: Present ‚Üí Past ‚Üí Future
- **Example**: "I'm currently a full-stack developer working with React and FastAPI. Previously, I built [specific project] which taught me [specific skill]. I'm looking to grow in [specific direction]."

### Common Questions & STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

1. **"Tell me about a challenging bug you fixed"**
   - Situation: What was the problem?
   - Task: What needed to be done?
   - Action: How did you approach it?
   - Result: What was the outcome?

2. **"How do you handle tight deadlines?"**
   - Prioritization strategies
   - Communication with stakeholders
   - Technical debt decisions

3. **"Describe a time you disagreed with a team member"**
   - Focus on collaboration and resolution
   - Show respect for different perspectives

## üèóÔ∏è System Design Basics

### Chat Application Architecture (relevant to your project!)

```
Frontend (React) ‚Üî API Gateway ‚Üî Backend (FastAPI) ‚Üî Database
                                     ‚Üì
                               WebSocket Server
```

**Key Components:**
- **Frontend**: React with state management
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints + WebSockets for real-time
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Database**: User data, chat history, sessions
- **Caching**: Redis for active sessions

### Scalability Considerations
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across servers
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization
- **Caching Strategies**: Redis, CDN for static assets
- **Message Queues**: Handle async operations

## üí≠ Problem-Solving Approach

### When Given a Coding Challenge:

1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - "What should happen if the input is empty?"
   - "Are there any constraints on time/space complexity?"
   - "Should I handle edge cases like null values?"

2. **Think Out Loud**
   - Explain your approach before coding
   - Discuss trade-offs between solutions
   - Mention alternative approaches

3. **Start Simple**
   - Get a working solution first
   - Then optimize if needed
   - Test with examples

4. **Code Organization**
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Consider error handling

## üîß Technical Deep Dives

### React Performance Questions

**"How would you optimize a slow React component?"**
- Check for unnecessary re-renders (React DevTools)
- Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
- Optimize state structure (avoid deeply nested objects)
- Use `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive calculations
- Consider component splitting

**"Explain React's reconciliation process"**
- Virtual DOM diffing algorithm
- Key prop importance in lists
- Fiber architecture (React 16+)

### JavaScript Fundamentals

**"Explain closures"**
```js
function outer(x) {
  return function inner(y) {
    return x + y; // inner has access to x
  };
}
const add5 = outer(5);
console.log(add5(10)); // 15
```

**"What's the event loop?"**
- Call stack ‚Üí Web APIs ‚Üí Callback queue ‚Üí Event loop
- Microtasks vs Macrotasks
- Promise resolution priority

### API Design Questions

**"How would you design a REST API for a chat system?"**

```
GET    /api/chats          - List user's chats
POST   /api/chats          - Create new chat
GET    /api/chats/:id      - Get specific chat history
POST   /api/chats/:id/messages - Send message
DELETE /api/chats/:id      - Delete chat
```

**Status Codes:**
- 200: Success with data
- 201: Created successfully
- 204: Success, no content
- 400: Bad request (validation error)
- 401: Unauthorized (need auth)
- 403: Forbidden (auth but no permission)
- 404: Not found
- 429: Rate limited
- 500: Server error

## üé® CSS & Design Questions

**"How would you make a responsive navbar?"**
```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .navbar {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  
  .nav-menu {
    display: none;
  }
  
  .nav-menu.active {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

**"Explain CSS specificity"**
- Inline styles (1000)
- IDs (100)
- Classes, attributes, pseudo-classes (10)  
- Elements and pseudo-elements (1)

## üöÄ Questions to Ask Them

### About the Role
- "What does a typical day look like?"
- "What are the biggest technical challenges the team faces?"
- "How do you measure success in this position?"

### About the Team
- "How does the team collaborate on projects?"
- "What's the code review process like?"
- "How do you handle technical debt?"

### About Growth
- "What opportunities are there for learning and development?"
- "Where do you see this role in 6 months?"

## üìù Final Tips

### During the Interview
- **Ask questions throughout** - shows engagement
- **Admit when you don't know something** - then explain how you'd find out
- **Show your thought process** - they want to see how you think
- **Be specific with examples** - use your actual projects
- **Practice whiteboarding** - get comfortable coding without autocomplete

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Badmouthing previous employers
- Not asking any questions
- Being unprepared about the company
- Not being able to explain your own code
- Getting defensive about feedback

### Your Chatbot Project Talking Points
- **Authentication flow** you implemented
- **Real-time chat** functionality decisions
- **State management** patterns you used
- **API design** choices you made
- **Problem-solving** examples from debugging
